# Rubik's Cube Group Theory Exploration

This project uses group theory to analyze the Rubik's Cube, offering insights into its algebraic structure. The main content is in **cube.ipynb**, where we explore various mathematical aspects of the cube's moves and transformations.

## Requirements

- **SageMath**: Required to run the notebook.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: To view and interact with the project.

## Getting Started

1. **Install SageMath**: See [SageMath installation](https://www.sagemath.org/download.html).
2. **Run the Notebook**: Open **cube.ipynb** in Jupyter with the SageMath kernel.

Alternatively, you can run this notebook on platforms like [CoCalc](https://cocalc.com/) that support SageMath.
